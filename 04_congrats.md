# Congrats 

You are a python expert now!

I'm guessing if you got this far, you had to 
- mess with the terminal a little bit 
- debug some weird errors
- made some typos couldn't figue out
- googled some stuff that didn't make any sense
- questioned why these instructions are so confusing (oh the guy who wrote _that_ code is the worst)


I mean if you did some of that you're an expert now, idk what to tell you
